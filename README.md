This repository provides an example on how to make your interaction data available through Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI, http://globalbioticinteractions.org).

If you have comments or questions please [open an issue](https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/issues/new).

## Share Your Interaction Data
If you want to share your own data through GloBI:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Edit your ```README.rd``` to describe your data in a human readable form.
3. Ensure that your README.rd contains a reference to ```http://globalbioticinteractions.org```.
4. Edit your ```globi.json``` to provide a machine readable description of your dataset (e.g. citation, license, version, files, format).

After you do this, the data will be available through GloBI within a day or so.

## Data Format and Dictionary
The file [interactions.tsv](./interactions.tsv) is a suggestion on how to encode your interaction data using a tab separated file format (tsv) in combination with columns described below. This provides an example on how to capture your data in a human and machine friendly way and keep it relatively doable to update the file using a basic text editor. Other formats are supported, just let us know about the syntax, and we'll make it work.

Each term has two columns: one for an id and another for a label. The former is to make the term machine readable, the latter to make is easy to read for humans. With both id and name present possible typos or other transcription errors can be detected with a (somewhat) straightforward algorithm.

## Term Id Sources
Rather than only supplying a name for a taxon and/or locality, a reference to some established taxonomy and/or geo database is preferred. Commonly used taxon id sources include, but are not limited to [GBIF](http://gbif.org), [EOL](http://eol.org),  [ITIS](http://itis.gov) and [WoRMS](http://marinespecies.org). Geo database or vocabularies include [geonames](http://geonames.org) and [Gazetteer Ontology](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/GAZ).
